 2. Turn on Bluetooth.
 3. Start the WJoy application.
 4. In the system tray, click the WJoy icon and click Begin Discovery.
 5. Turn on the Wiimote or Wii U Pro Controller by pressing any key on it.
 6. Press the sync button (red flat button on the controller) while in discovery mode.
 7. Once connected, configure the Wii U Pro controller as a Steam controller in Steam Big Picture Mode. Read more here: https://www.howtogeek.com/234427/how-to-remap-buttons-on-your-steam-controller/
 
In my experience, Unity games for Mac do not support the Wii U Pro Controller, since they tend to use the XInput package. There is no application that emulates an Xbox controller for Mac.
